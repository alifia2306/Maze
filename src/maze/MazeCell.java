/**
 *  The <code>MazeCell</code> class stores information about each individual cell
 *  in the maze.  The boolean values <code>north</code>, <code>east</code>,
 *  <code>west</code>, and <code>south</code> store which walls are up; e.g., if
 *  <code>north</code> is <code>true</code>, then the north wall is up.
 *  
 *  Each cell also has pointer to its four <code>MazeCell</code> neighbors,
 *  <code>neighborN</code>, <code>neighborE</code>, <code>neighborS</code>, and
 *  <code>neighborW</code>.  If any of these values are null, it means this cell
 *  is on the border of the maze.
